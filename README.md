# Dook Application

This app is built using react-native in combination with Expo.

do the following if you wanna open up the app

Assuming that you have Node 10 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility: <br/>

`git clone https://github.com/dook-robotics/dook-app.git` <br/>


`cd DookApp` <br/>

`npm install` <br/>

`npm install -g expo-cli` <br/>

`expo-cli start` <br/>

You can then view the app by using the iOS simulator (Make sure you have Xcode installed), an Android simulator (make sure you have Android studio installed), or by downloading the Expo app on your app store and scanning the QR Code. <br/>

Happy Programming :smile:
